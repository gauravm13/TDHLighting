      "description": "A 12CH wall mount electronic dimmer is an electronic device used to control the brightness of 12 separate lights or light fixtures. It is mounted on a wall and operates by adjusting the voltage supplied to the light, effectively reducing its brightness. This type of dimmer is often used in residential or commercial settings to create mood lighting, conserve energy, and extend the life of light bulbs. It typically operates using a switch or slider, and may include additional features such as adjustable minimum brightness and smooth dimming. In addition to controlling the brightness of lights, 12CH wall mount electronic dimmers can also help reduce energy consumption. By adjusting the voltage supplied to the lights, the dimmer can reduce the amount of power used, which can result in lower electricity bills. Additionally, electronic dimmers can extend the life of light bulbs by reducing the amount of heat generated during operation, which can reduce the risk of bulb failure.",
